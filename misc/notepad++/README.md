4. You may need to re-open your .roach files or restart notepad++ in order to see the highlighting changes.

## Limitation of the notepad++'s syntax highlight

Notepad++'s syntax highlight feature is a little bit limited. For example, the roach language has two types of line comments. Notepad++ seems could not highlight both. so you need to be careful about line comment. I suggest use only one type of comment across all your roach source.
